        We are a group of dedicated Information Technology students from Arizona State University, currently enrolled in the IFT 402: Information Technology Capstone Project II course. This course represents the culmination of our academic journey, allowing us to synthesize and apply the extensive knowledge and skills we have acquired throughout our program.
        <br><br>
        Our team formed around a shared passion for gaming and a common goal: to address the challenges faced by newcomers to Teamfight Tactics. Recognizing the game's steep learning curve, particularly in item combinations and strategic gameplay, we saw an opportunity to apply our IT skills in a meaningful way. Our project, the Teamfight Tactics Item Builder, aims to demystify the game's mechanics for new players, offering them a tool that enhances their gaming experience and increases their chances of success.
        <br><br>
        Throughout this project, we have embraced the AGILE methodology, a core aspect of our IFT 402 course. This approach has allowed us to work iteratively, adapting to challenges and feedback as we progress. Our agile practices have fostered a dynamic and responsive development environment, enabling us to efficiently address the needs of our target users and refine our technology solution.

        As students of the Information Technology program at ASU, we have been equipped with a robust foundation in technical knowledge, as well as the professional skills of teamwork and leadership. These skills have been invaluable in our project development, allowing us to collaborate effectively and lead our initiative towards its goals.
        <br><br>
        Our journey through IFT 401 introduced us to the principles of strategic management of information technology systems, from assessing emerging technologies to designing comprehensive solutions. Building on this foundation, IFT 402 has challenged us to implement a technology solution, bringing our theoretical knowledge into practical application.
        <br><br>
        We are more than just a team; we are a group of friends and future IT professionals who are passionate about making a positive impact in the gaming community. By leveraging our academic training and our enthusiasm for gaming, we aim to bridge the gap for newcomers to Teamfight Tactics, fostering a more inclusive and engaging environment for all players.
        <br><br>
        Our project is not just an academic exercise; it is a testament to our growth as IT professionals and our commitment to contributing meaningful solutions within the IT industry. We are excited to share our journey and the outcomes of our project with the broader ASU community and the world of Teamfight Tactics players.
